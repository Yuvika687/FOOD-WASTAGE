            <p>Welcome to WAY WASTAGE, where we believe in a world where no food goes to waste. Our journey began with a simple yet powerful idea — to create a platform that tackles the global issue of food wastage head-on. The objective of our website typically revolves around raising awareness about the issue of food wastage, educating visitors about the impact on the environment and society, and providing practical solutions and tips to reduce food wastage. Additionally, the website can serve as a platform to share recipes and meal ideas to prevent food wastage and share success stories.</p>
